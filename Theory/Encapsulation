Data hiding is also known as encapsulation. It is a process of forming objects. An encapsulated object is often called as an abstract data type. We need to encapsulate
data because the programmer often make various mistakes and the data gets changed acidentally. Thus, to protect the data we need to struct a secure and impassable wall 
to protect the data. Data hiding is nothing but making data variable of the class private. 
The keywords "private" and "protected" are used for hiding the data.
